### ðŸ“§ Email Analysis - LetsDefend Challenge

Overview
I completed the Email Analysis challenge on LetsDefend, where I got hands-on experience analyzing a suspicious email. The goal was to check the email headers, look at the attachments, and figure out if the email was part of a phishing attempt or malware attack.

What I Did
1. Checked the Email â€“ Looked at the sender, recipient, subject, and other email details.
2. Attachment Investigation â€“ Unzipped and reviewed the attached file to see if it was suspicious.
3. IP and Hash Analysis â€“ Found the IP address the email came from and verified the fileâ€™s hash to confirm if it was malicious.

Results
1. I was able to confirm the email was malicious and completed the challenge with 100% accuracy.
2. I earned a badge for finishing the challenge.
3. The challenge was rated as Medium difficulty, and it helped me improve my skills as a Security Analyst.
